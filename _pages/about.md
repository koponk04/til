I am a coder, tinkerer, and occasional chaos coordinator from Bogor. I love building things that work and sometimes breaking them just to see if I can fix them better. I spend my days wrangling code in Python, PHP, and FastAPI, and learning new things along the way, yesterday it was COBOL. I plant coffee on my hometown fields and when I am old I will be a full-time farmer.

I am a part-time problem solver and a full-time curious mind. I write about tech, life experiments, and the weird intersections between software logic and real-world hacks. I am always testing, always learning, never boring.
